# Potato Clicker

Potato Clicker is the first game developing project that I have created.
It was part of my diploma project in High School and it thought me a lot about game developing.
The game has added scripts written by myself in C# which make the game what it is today.

# Project Specifications
- You can choose between two characters
- You can purchase upgrades to help you click faster
- There is some background music
- It has multiple menus

# Where you can play it
- In the project files you can find the build files and you can see the evolution of the game throughout the developing journey.
