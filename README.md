# Potato Clicker

Potato Clicker is the first game developing project that I have created.
It was part of my diploma project in High School and it thought me a lot about game developing.
The game has added scripts written by myself in C# which make the game what it is today.

# Project Specifications
- You can choose between two characters
- You can purchase upgrades to help you click faster
- There is some background music
- It has multiple menus

# How to get the game and play it
It is fairly simple, you just have to download the "Build4.0.zip" file and in there
you will find "Potato-Atestat.exe". Just double click on that and you are in the game
Enjoy!
